# Changelog

All notable changes to Sharingan are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Adding a task no longer creates it twice: every text field submits through a single `.onSubmit` — the legacy `TextField(onCommit:)` fired a second time on end-editing with the field's stale text (`SubmitWiringTests` now lints the pattern out)
- Menu-bar popover is readable under system Light mode: it pins its own dark appearance instead of inheriting light from the menu bar it's anchored to, which rendered the dark-glass design's white text on a light popover

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-12

First public release. 🍅👁️

### Pomodoro
- Configurable focus / short break / long break durations (25/5/15 defaults), long break every N pomodoros
- Countdown and count-up modes, auto-start toggles, repeat with delay
- Natural-language time input — `5 min`, `2h 30m`, `5pm`, `+5m`, `-1h`, `reset`
- Global shortcuts: ⌃⌥Space start/pause, ⌃⌥F skip, ⌃⌥R reset, ⌃⌥+ add 5 min, ⌃⌥L floating timer

### Breaks & eye health
- Full-screen, multi-monitor break overlay at screen-saver level; ⌘Q/⌘W/⌘Tab blocked until the break ends
- Eye exercises: 20-20-20, 8-direction gaze, blink drills — with camera blink/gaze validation (Vision, fully on-device)
- TTS voice guidance, pulsing camera privacy badge
- Break comfort: ambience sounds (rain, forest, white noise, lo-fi), smooth screen dim, optional Night Shift warmth
- Posture / water / custom interval reminders

### Tasks
- Full task system: P1–P4 priorities, tags, projects, due dates, notes, subtasks, recurrence, templates, snooze
- Natural-language quick add (English + Uzbek): `ertaga 15:00 p1 #ish ~2 hisobot yozish`
- Focus queue — each finished pomodoro advances to the next task; post-break picker
- Eisenhower matrix, per-project/tag stats, floating Today panel
- `sharingan://` URL scheme for Shortcuts / Raycast

### Sharingan
- 18 eye styles — 1/2/3-tomoe, Mangekyō variants, Rinnegan and more, with pattern evolution

### More
